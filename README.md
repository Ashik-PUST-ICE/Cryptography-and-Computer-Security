- **Cryptography Library**: For encryption and decryption operations
- **Hashlib**: For secure hashing functions

Ensure you have Python 3 and install required libraries:
```bash
pip install cryptography
⚙️ Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository:


git clone <repository-url>
cd Cryptography-and-Computer-Security
Install Dependencies: Install the necessary Python packages as listed in requirements.txt.


pip install -r requirements.txt
Run Scripts: Each module has standalone scripts for various cryptographic functions:


python symmetric_encryption.py
🚀 Usage Guide
Each script in this project demonstrates a unique cryptographic or security protocol:

Symmetric Encryption: Run symmetric_encryption.py for AES and DES examples.
Asymmetric Encryption: Use rsa_encryption.py for RSA encryption and decryption.
Hashing: Execute hashing_example.py to try out MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 hashes.
Refer to each script's README for specific instructions and usage examples.
